# FRC_573_2019_Robot

This is the repo for FRC team 573's 2019 robot code. This will be a private repo until the end of the 2019 FRC season, so if anyone needs access talk to Coach Eric, who can grant them access. 

Remember the Team 573 Programming Help Docs can be found here.

And feel free to look at the 2018 robot code for help as well.
